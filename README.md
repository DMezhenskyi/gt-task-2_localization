# GreentubeTask2 (Localization)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

This module had some problems and I had to create few hacks. I described the issues in comments
I also removed dist folder form .gitignore so you can find compiled bundles under root directory.
Source code was build with -prod and -aot flags 


## Development server
Run `npm install`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
